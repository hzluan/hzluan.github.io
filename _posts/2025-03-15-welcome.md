description: "First post on my new blog — why I'm writing about AI, healthcare, and research."
---

I have been meaning to start writing about my research for a while. This blog is where I will share thoughts on AI in healthcare and reflections from my PhD journey at UC Berkeley and UCSF.

## What to expect

I plan to write about a few recurring themes:

- **Why things don't work?** — why an AI tool might not work as well as you think in healthcare settings
- **How can they work better?** — reflections from the failures and real-life clinical insights to guide AI deployment in healthcare
- **Bigger Pictures**
