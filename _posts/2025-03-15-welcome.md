description: "First post on my new blog — why I'm writing about AI, healthcare, and research."
---

I have been meaning to start writing about my research for a while. This blog is where I will share thoughts on AI in healthcare, methodological ideas, and reflections from my PhD journey at UC Berkeley and UCSF.

## What to expect

I plan to write about a few recurring themes:

- **Missing data in healthcare** — why it matters and what we can learn from it
- **AI governance** — reflections from my work with CITED on California legislation
- **Research tooling** — practical tips on coding, reproducibility, and workflow

## Why a blog?

Academic papers are slow. Conference talks reach a narrow audience. A blog lets me share ideas early, get feedback, and document the messy middle of research that never makes it into a publication.

I will try to keep posts short and focused. If you have questions or want to discuss anything, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:hluan@berkeley.edu).
